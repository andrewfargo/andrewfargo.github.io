    <p>Hi all, just a short update tonight.</p>
    
    <p>
      I've spent the better part of the week trying to repair my old Singer machine (soon to be a post, hopefully).
      In the meantime, I've added RSS support for this blog!
      If you go to either <a href="/index.html">my main page</a> or <a href="/blog.html">my blog home</a>, a graphical link to the RSS feed is now present: <a href="/rss.xml"><img src="/media/rss.svg" width="18" height="18" alt="RSS"></img></a>.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      I was hoping to add support for an RSS subdomain, e.g. <code>rss.dfargo.com</code> (invalid link), but had trouble getting it to work with GitHub pages. Alas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next I think I want to get rid of some friction with uploading posts.
      Currently, I have to
      <ol>
	<li>copy over a template HTML file,</li>
	<li>write the article,</li>
	<li>fill out the metadata in the article text</li>
	<li>fill out the metadata in the HTML</li>
	<li>fill out the metadata in the RSS feed</li>
	<li>update the <a href="/blog.html">blog home;</a></li>
      </ol>
      and, this is all without support for categories, for which I would also have to update regularly. My ideal solution would be converting a LaTeX document into
      the proper HTML and RSS, as well as a tool to convert RSS to a set of navigational pages. This is in the works and I will create a blog post should I finish it.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's all, goodnight!
