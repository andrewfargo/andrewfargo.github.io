	<h1>"Why <em>does</em> your website look like that?"</h1>

	<i>My site looks like it was made in the mid-oughts. But why?</i>
	<p>
	  As I'm rebuilding this site, I feel its worth answering this question for
	  myself and for those who are curious. I think it comes down to a few reasons:
	  accessibility, ease of writing, and
	  preference. I'll try my best to explain what I mean.
	</p>

	<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

	<p>
	  I'll preface this section by saying I'm not, by any metric, an expert in accessibility.
	  It <i>is</i> important that we all be mindful of accessibility. Folks smarter than me
	  have demonstrated time and again that accessibility, in addition to making systems
	  remotely tolerable for some, benefits everybody.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I'm working on a separate, better researched post about web accessibility.
	  In the meantime, it suffices to say that concise, machine-readable HTML is
	  the most feasible way for me to keep this site accessible.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="ease">Ease of writing</h2>

	<p>
	  Secondly, I write pages like this by hand.
	  I've used tools like <tt>jekyll</tt>, <tt>org-publish</tt>, and <tt>tex4ht</tt>
	  in the past for writing blog posts, but I find that it's just too difficult or
	  inconsistent for my purposes. I much prefer having control over the page's markup.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Thus, for a similar reason to accessibility, keeping the HTML simple
	  and semantic is one of the only feasible ways to do this.
	  I don't want to hand-write fifty <tt>div</tt>s, or copy and paste
	  templates to that effect.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A nice benefit of hand-writing these pages is stability.
	  It reminds me of when you visit an old BBC page and you're teleported back to the 2000's;
	  as long as the filepaths stay the same,
	  this page can sit unchanged.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="preference">Preference</h2>

	<p>
	  Finally, I'm just a fan of the late 90's early 00's look.
	  It harkens to a time when you didn't need a mega-corporation in order to make
	  a page just about you. (I am hosting this on GitHub, but I've written a webserver before
	  and want to use it in the future!)
	</p>

	<p>
	  Nothing beats accessible, timeless simplicity, and I think that's pretty cool.
