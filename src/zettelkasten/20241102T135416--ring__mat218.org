* Ring

A ring is a set equipped with two operators, addition and multiplication.
The ring must be an [[denote:20241102T135935][Abelian Group]] with its addition operator, and multiplication
must be associative, distribute over addition, and have an identity element.

The set of integers with standard notions of addition and multiplication form a ring,
though that ring is actually commutative. (wrt multiplication)
