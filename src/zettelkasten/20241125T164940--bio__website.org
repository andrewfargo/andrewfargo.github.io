* Biography

Hello! This is a bit of stand-in page while I get everything else settled.
For now, here is my LinkedIn Bio:

Hi! I'm a student at Grinnell College studying computer science, math, and linguistics. I have a particular passion for computational linguistics, Linux, and PL. I love looking into the unexpected genius in implementation and design behind our everyday technology.

Currently, I spend my time teaching what I know at iD tech, learning about the kernel, and (trying) to make crosswords. For those who are curious, I think Emacs is the better text editor. ;-)
